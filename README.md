<h1><p align="center">[EXERCISES SOLUTION] Speech and Language Process Book</p>
</h1>

# Repository Objective
This repository serves the purpose of hosting solutions to exercises I've completed from the book [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/), authored by Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin (3rd ed. draft). Offering comprehensive insights into Natural Language Processing, this book stands as a personal favorite of mine. I strongly recommend it to anyone engaged in NLP studies.
